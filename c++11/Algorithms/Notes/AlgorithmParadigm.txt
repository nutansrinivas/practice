Algorithm Paradigms / Algorithm Design Paradigm / Algorithm Technique / Algorithm Strategy : is a generic method or appraoch which underlies the design of a class of algorithms

Different types of appraoches are :

#	Brute Force		: refers to a programming style that doesn't include any shortcuts to improve performance, 
									instead relies on sheer computing power to try all possibilities until the solution to a problem found. 
									time complexity of brute force is o(n*m)
				Example : selection sort, bubble sort, sequential search, brute force string matching, closest pair problem, 
									convex hull problem, travelling salesman problem, knapsack problem, assignment problem 

#	Divide and Conquer	:	break the problem into sub problems of same type, recursively solve each sub problem. 
												combine all sub problem solutions to solve main problem.
				Example	:	merge sort, quick sort, binary search, binary tree traversal, multiplication of large integers, 
									stassen's matrix multiplication, closest pair problem, convex hull problem, 
	
#	Decrease and Conquer
# Transform and Conquer
#	Space and Tradeoff
#	Dynamic Programming
#	Greedy Technique
#	Back Tracking
#	Branch and Bound
